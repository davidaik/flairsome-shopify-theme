## Shopify theme based on Venture

This theme is based on the official free [Venture](https://themes.shopify.com/themes/venture/styles/snowboards) theme for Shopify.

This version includes a few bugfixes and has some additional features.

The official theme was downloaded and ported to Slate 0.14.0, so now this theme is a Slate theme. You will need to install [Slate 0.14.0](https://shopify.github.io/slate/docs/0.14.0/) to work with and build this theme.


### Bugs fixed:

1. Components of the navigation drawer glitching during close animation.
2. Autocomplete suggestions of the search bar appearing at a weird position when the header search box is being expanded.

### Additional features:

1. Added "Related Products" section on product pages. Shows 5 items.
2. Added "User Reviews" section. Requires the official Shopify reviews app.
